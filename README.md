## Install

```console
$ npm i @libp2p/record
```

## Description

Implementation of [go-libp2p-record](https://github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p-record) in JavaScript.

## Usage

See <https://libp2p.github.io/js-libp2p-record/>

## Contribute

The libp2p implementation in JavaScript is a work in progress. As such, there are a few things you can do right now to help out:

- Go through the modules and **check out existing issues**. This is especially useful for modules in active development. Some knowledge of IPFS/libp2p may be required, as well as the infrastructure behind it - for instance, you may need to read up on p2p and more complex operations like muxing to be able to help technically.
- **Perform code reviews**. More eyes will help a) speed the project along b) ensure quality and c) reduce possible future bugs.
